# React Flux Asp.Net CRUD Example - Invoicing app

The purpose of this project is to explore the potential of Flux+React for developing a CRUD application with minimal amount of code. To reach this goal, a number of libraries and tools are used (react-router, reflux, newforms).
The secondary objective is to establish a sound development environment and workflow when developing React applications along ASP.NET, and embedding React in the already existing application (using node,webpack,gulp,task runner, sublime etc.).
